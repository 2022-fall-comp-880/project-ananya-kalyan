### Description

The Data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various 
subjects.This data set includes scores from three exams and a variety of 
personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them.
It also contain the details of which grade the student belongs to and helps 
us to determine the status of student preparation.
 

**1** How effective is the test preparation course?

**2** Which major factors contribute to test outcomes?

**3** What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?


### Requirements

 The python packages that are useful in my project may be `os`, `csv`, `unittest`, `warning` and may be more packages.

- The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.The *os* and *os.path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.
- Python unittest is a built-in testing framework to test Python code. It has a test runner, which allows us to run the tests without much effort.
- The `warning` module is used to show warning messages. The warning module is actually a subclass of Exception which is a built-in class in Python.
